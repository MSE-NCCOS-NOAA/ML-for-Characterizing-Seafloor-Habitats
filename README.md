# MLforCharacterizingSeafloorHabitats
# Marine managers routinely use spatial data and maps to make decisions about the resources in their jurisdiction. These spatial datasets and maps are critical for managers to establish baselines, and detect changes overtime in the health, abundance and distribution of marine resources, including benthic habitats. In the past, benthic habitat maps were developed by visually delineating and classifying features in aerial or satellite images. This approach was time consuming and subjective. In the last decade, advances in spatial modeling techniques, including machine learning and deep learning approaches, now make it easier to standardize the process used to characterize benthic habitats. These approaches also make it easier to quantify the uncertainty and precision associated with the characterization process. Both advances in habitat map making are critical for managers in a changing climate, allowing them to better track habitat changes over time, and to better understand the error bars around those changes at broad spatial scales (10s to 1000s of kilometers).

# This code base uses boosted regression trees (BRTs) to develop benthic habitat predictions and maps. We used this modeling technique because it is flexible, robust, and compares favorably to other machine learning techniques (Elith et al. 2006; Elith et al. 2008, De'eath and Fabricius 2000; De'ath 2007). BRTs model complex relationships between organisms and the environment by developing many (hundreds to thousands) simple regression (tree) models. Regression trees (Breiman et al., 1984) relate a response to environmental predictors by iteratively splitting the data into two homogenous groups. These models are built in a stage-wise fashion, where existing trees are left unchanged and the variance remaining from the last tree is used to fit the next one. This stage-wise process is called boosting. A random subset of data is used to fit a model at each stage. This randomization helps improve model performance (Friedman, 2002; Elith et al., 2008). These simple models are then combined linearly to produce one final combined model (Elith et al., 2008). The fitted values in this combined model are more stable than values from an individual model, improving its overall predictive performance (Friedman, 2002; Elith et al., 2006, Elith et al., 2008).
